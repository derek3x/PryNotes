Difference between website and github source:

-Removed secret keys
-Simplified the encryption.  I did this to avoid having the encryption method out.  I use the keyczar still on the website, but include a special changing salt and extra security.  On the github version I use just the keyczar encryption.  This is simply a security thing for the website.
-This version is setup to use sqlite.  Just makes it easier to test and run locally.  It is a super quick change.

    python virtualenv.py flask
